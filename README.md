# Group Project - Krave - React Front End

### How it was built
We used React, Bootstrap and Ruby-on-Rails for the backend

### Team Members

### Features 
The project was aimed to solve an unmet need in the market to display, share and search for restaurant menus with dietary information.

Users can search for cuisine or specific restaurants using the search bar on the home page. They can view the menu from the search results, which displays each item.

Users can also create an account with login details , which will authenticate upon each login. For restaurant owners, they can also access a control panel to create and modify menu items along with their restaurant details.

### Bugs
- Currently there are missing nav items to existing components
- The search bar is at the bottom of the page due to CSS challenges
- There are kittens for all images. This is not indicative of the cuisine of the restaurants within this website
- The google maps component does not seem to work well within github pages and is not rendering

### Wishlist / Planned Features
- Dietary information on the menu items
- A working google maps api component
- Nav links
- Optimisation of user flows
